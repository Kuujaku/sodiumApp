Simple java gui that writes numbers to txt file

Specially made for TrellionSpiers (twitch.tv/trellionspiers),
but anyone can use this as they please.


#Usage#

1. On the first textfield you add the amount wanted to write inside a text file.

2. Second textfield is for multiplying the first field. This will also add the
multiplied value to text file.

All added values will be printed on the All todays... textarea.

3. Save all data gives all added values a date format followed by a new line
so it must be pressed last when all desired values are on the textarea.


IF you don't want to add multipliers ONLY use the first textfield.
Same with if you want to use multiplier use only Multiply & Save.
